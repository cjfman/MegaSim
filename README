megasim [options] program

The program should either be a binary file or an intel hex file that represents
an executable AVR program

Options:

-h  	specifies that the program is a hex file. This will be auto-detected if
		the file ends in .hex.

-o		sets the I/O address to map to stdout

-e		sets the I/O address to map to stdin

-p		sets the list of peripherals to be added to the execution. The required
		argument should be a comma separated list of paths to executables
